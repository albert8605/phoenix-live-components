# phoenix-live-components
A simple page to show some examples of components using Phoenix LiveView. Integrating [Surface](https://surface-ui.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), it's use Phoenix 1.7, and phoenix_live_view 0.19.1 because this was the version compatible with Surface at the moment of created this project.
